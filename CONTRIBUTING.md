# Contributing to the Vignette wiki

Want to contribute to the Vignette wiki? Great!

Before that, keep in mind a couple of points.

1. We use [MKDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) as our wiki framework.

   

2. All the pages should be neutral, and use second person to refer to the user where possible.

   

3. Avoid using inline HTML where possible.

   

4. Please follow International English grammar rules.

   

## Markdown styling

We are very strict about styling, to keep the wiki as consistent as possible.

- Use `-` to create bullet lists
  
  ```md
  - Item 1
  - Item 2
  - Item 3
  ...
  ```

- Use `.` to create ordered lists
  
  ```md
  1. Item 1
  2. Item 2
  3. Item 3
  ...
  ```

- Use 4 spaces for indentation

## Embedding images

All images should be put in the `img/` directory relative to the current document.

Example:

```
docs/
     index.md
     img/
         menu.png
```

All images should have a description explaining what the image is

```md
![The Vignette main menu](img/menu.png)
```
